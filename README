#pytricubic

pytricubic is a simple Python wrapper for the tricubic interpolation algorithm
by Lekien and Marsden in the implementation by David Kirkby
(https://github.com/deepzot/likely). I drastically improved performance by
doing the matrix multiplication with the linear algebra template library Eigen.

This code is only a basic wrapper around the interpolator. Taking numpy arrays
instead of Python lists would be desirable.

The tricubic interpolation scheme is described in:

  Lekien, F. and Marsden, J.: Tricubic interpolation in three dimensions.
                              In: International Journal for Numerical Methods
                              in Engineering (2005), No. 63, p. 455-471

##0. Building

This chapter assumes that you are working in a standard Linux environment with
tools like g++ and cmake already installed. The Eigen linear algebra library and
Boost are required to compile this code. Both can be obtained and installed 
easily on every Linux distribution.

required:
* [Eigen >=3.1.3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* [Boost >=1.48](http://www.boost.org/)

After having installed the required dependencies, the source code can be
downloaded and compiled. Adjusting the EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR path in CMakeLists.txt
to the path where you installed Eigen is necessary.

  git clone git://github.com/danielguterding/pytricubic.git
  cd pytricubic
  cmake --build .

##1. Usage

An example of how to use the interpolator class is given in tricubic.py.
